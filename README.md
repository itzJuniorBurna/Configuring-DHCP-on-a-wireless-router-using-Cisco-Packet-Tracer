The steps I took in configuring DHCP on a wireless router using the Cisco Packet Tracer 

 
 <h2>BACKGROUND</h2> 
 
 In this project, I connected three PCs to a wireless router, changed the DHCP setting to a specific network range and configured the clients to obtain their address via DHCP. 
 
 The first step I took was to connect each generic PC to an ethernet port to the wireless router using straight-through cables and waited for the amber lights to turn green before I made any further configurations.

 After the amber lights turned green, I dynamically assigned an IP address to the PCs

 I then change the default IP address of the wireless router and the default DHCP range of addresses.

 Finally, I verified connectivity to the wireless router by pinging the IP address of the PCs from PC2
